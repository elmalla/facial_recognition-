## Python Project for facial recognition of patients & Outdoor crowd 

Face recognition with OpenCV, Python, and deep learning detected a patient whose identity was unknown and using old pictures for him, the model detected him sucessfully
even with accident marks on his face.

A second test was performed on crowd outdoor gathering and the model performed also well.  

The code was part of a complete solution submitted in a healthcare competition. Using a smart glass and smart watch, government personal can monitor people health in contactless setting.

The image shows an example of recognized faces:
